# Visualize Netflix data using Python

In this project, we act as a data visualization developer at Yahoo Finance! We are helping the "Netflix Stock Profile" team visualize the Netflix stock data. In finance, a stock profile is a series of studies, visualizations, and analyses that dive into different aspects a publicly traded company's data.

**Data** is loaded from 3 files:
- `NFLX.csv`
- `DJI.csv`
- `NFLX_daily_by_quarter.csv`
Financial Data Source: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DATA/)

**For the purposes of the project, we only visualize data for the year of 2017.** Specifically:

+ The distribution of the stock prices for the past year
+ Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters
+ The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017
+ A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017

Note: We are using the Dow Jones Industrial Average to compare the Netflix stock to the larter stock market.

During this project, we:
- analyze, 
- prepare, 
- plot data. 

Our visualizations will help the financial analysts asses the risk of the Netflix stock.
