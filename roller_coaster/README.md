# Roller Coaster

## Project Goals

Work to create several data visualizations that will give insight into the world of roller coasters.

## Data
Roller coasters are often split into two main categories based on their construction material: **wood** or **steel**. Rankings for the best wood and steel roller coasters from the 2013 to 2018 [Golden Ticket Awards](http://goldenticketawards.com) are provded in `'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Wood.csv'` and `'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Steel.csv'`, respectively. 

[Captain Coaster](https://captaincoaster.com/en/) is a popular site for recording roller coaster information. Data on all roller coasters documented on Captain Coaster has been accessed through its API and stored in `roller_coasters.csv`. 

## Questions to answer:

+ Comparing rankings of roller coasters over time
+ Ploting statistic values, like speed, length, height and number of inversions for roller coasters in given data/
+ What roller coaster seating type is most popular? 
+ Do different seating types result in higher/faster/longer roller coasters?
+ Do roller coaster manufactures have any specialties (do they focus on speed, height, seating type, or inversions)?
+ Do amusement parks have any specialties?
