# Casual Coded Correspondence

In this training project, we are working to code and decode various messages between us and our fictional cryptography enthusiast pen pal Vishal. 

Tasks of the project:

- decode Vishal's message using an offset of 10 letters;
- coding own message using the same offset;
- making functions for decoding and coding;
- solving a word puzzle without knowing the shift value, by iterating through range of possible values and finding there meaningfull decoded message;
- solving the Vigenère Cipher, where the value of the shift for each letter is determined by a given keyword;
- coding and sending message with the Vigenère Cipher back.
