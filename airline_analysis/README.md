# Airline Analysis

In this training project we want to make sure that we can find the best deal for client of travel agency and help them to understand how airline prices change based on different factors.

The data is loaded from `flight.csv` and includes:

- *miles*: miles traveled through the flight
- *passengers*: number of passengers on the flight
- *delay*: take-off delay in minutes
- *inflight_meal*: is there a meal included in the flight?
- *inflight_entertainment*: are there free entertainment systems for each seat?
- *inflight_wifi*: is there complimentary wifi on the flight?
- *day_of_week*: day of the week of the flight
- *weekend*: did this flight take place on a weekend?
- *coach_price*: the average price paid for a coach ticket
- *firstclass_price*: the average price paid for first-class seats
- *hours*: how many hours the flight took
- *redeye*: was this flight a redeye (overnight)?


## Univariate Analysis

1. What do coach ticket prices look like? What are the high and low values? What would be considered the average? Does $500 seem like a good price for a coach ticket?
2. Visualizing the coach ticket prices for flights that are 8 hours long. What are the high, low, and average prices for 8-hour-long flights? Does a $500 dollar ticket seem more reasonable than before?
3. How are flight delay times distributed? What kinds of delays are typical?

## Bivariate Analysis

1. Creating visualization that shows the relationship between coach and first-class prices. What is the relationship between these two prices? Do flights with higher coach prices always have higher first-class prices as well?
2. What is the relationship between coach prices and inflight features â€” inflight meal, inflight entertainment, and inflight WiFi? Which features are associated with the highest increase in price?
3. How does the number of passengers change in relation to the length of flights?

## Multivariate Analysis

1. Visualizing relationship between coach and first-class prices on weekends compared to weekdays.
2. How do coach prices differ for redeyes and non-redeyes on each day of the week?
