# Biodiversity in National Parks
A repository to contain the data, code and final output of the CodeCademy Biodiversity project.

## Project description
For this project, we interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

- perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of species;
- investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. 

During this project, we analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

## Questions we want to answer:
- What is the distribution of conservation_status for animals?
- What is observation destribution by conservation status?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
- Which species were spotted the most at each park?
- Finding relationships between categories and their protection status.

### Also we looked up some specific types of animals and plants
* Finding sheeps in the data
 - Observations of sheeps by park in a week
* Finding fern in the data
 - Observations of ferns by park in a week
