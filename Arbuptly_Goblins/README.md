 # Planning the game night
 
 In this training project we are planing game night for the Sorcery Society book store.
 Customers love to play their favorite RPG, "Abruptly Goblins!" and will happily pay you per chair to secure the space to do it.
 
 *To plan the game night we are:*
 
 - creating gamer list with gamer names and their availability;
 - calculating which nights would have the most participation by adding each gamers availability to frequency table by day of the week and finding best night;
 - making list of the people available on best night;
 - generating an e-mail for the participants.
 
 
 *As we want to invite those, who was not able to participate in first game night:*
 
 - we are making a list of those, who not attended first game night;
 - finding their best availability day of the week;
 - sending invitation email to all gamers from full gamer list, who is available on that day, in case those, who was attending first game night and is available on the second game night would want to attend as well.
