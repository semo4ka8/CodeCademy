# Life Expectancy and GDP project

For this project, we are analyzing data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

## **Data:**
for this project we load data from file `all_data.csv`

The dataset provided has the following columns of data:

- `Country` - nation
- `Year` - the year for the observation
- `Life expectancy at birth (years)` - life expectancy value in years
- `GDP` - Gross Domestic Product in U.S. dollars

**Gross domestic product (GDP)** is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services (less imports). While GDP is the single most important indicator to capture economic activity, it falls short of providing a suitable measure of people's material well-being for which alternative indicators may be more appropriate. 

## During this project we are:
- analyzing, 
- preparing, 
- ploting data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way,
- show some summary statistics and visually examine data,
- write out some insights that we have gained along with our analysis. 

We build graphs from the data by using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` and then making some plots!

## **Questions we answer:**

- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
- What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
