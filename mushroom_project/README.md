# Exploring Mushrooms

Mushrooms exist in a variety of different colors, shapes, sizes, textures, etc. In this project, you will analyze an extensive mushroom dataset from UCI using bar charts and acquaint yourself with the diverse array of mushrooms that exist worldwide. 

## Data:

We load data from `mushroom_data.txt` that was loaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification).

## Goals:

- created 23 informative plots,
- titled, 
- labeled clearly, 
- ordered.

Using these visualizations, it is easy to tell which features of mushrooms are common and rare, and we get insights into the variety of mushrooms in the fungi kingdom.
