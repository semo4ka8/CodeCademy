# Flask FM project

In this project, I am creating a web service, called FlaskFM, that allow users to add songs to their personalized list from a song library curated by an administrator through a dashboard page. 

I am modeling users and playlists that can be changed by users who add or remove songs. 

The project work focuses on the database aspect, but also I am creating a functional web service for users with HTML templates and routes.
