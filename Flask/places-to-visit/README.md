#Places to visit
In this project I built a simple app to track interesting places, dividing them to 3 categories: recommended, to visit and visited. 

To implement this idea I used combined knowledge of Python, Flask and HTML.

Also, app has an option to add new places to one of the categories, as well as moving the place up the category or delete it.

Data with places and description for the app is downloaded from the CSV file `data.csv`

Main application implementation can be found in `app.py`
