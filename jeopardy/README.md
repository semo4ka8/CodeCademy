# This Is Jeopardy!

Data Manipulation with Pandas

**Data** is loaded from `jeopardy.csv`

**Project Goals**

- We work to write several functions that investigate a dataset of Jeopardy! questions and answers. 
- Filter the dataset for topics that weâ€™re interested in.
- Compute the average difficulty of those questions and train to become the next Jeopardy champion!

Also we investigate:

- How many questions from the 90s use the word "Computer" compared to questions from the 2000s?
- Is there a connection between the round and the category?
- Are you more likely to find certain categories, like "Literature" in Single Jeopardy or Double Jeopardy?

Finally we build a system to quiz ourselves!
