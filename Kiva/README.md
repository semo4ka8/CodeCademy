# Visualizing Kiva Data With Seaborn

In this project, we are visualizing and looking for insights in a dataset from Kaggle. 

**Data** [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fkosmowski/kivadhsv1) contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/).

Using Seaborn, we are:

- exploring the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts, 
- visualizing the distribution of loan amount by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots,
- using different styling techniques,
- finding insights based on visualizations.
