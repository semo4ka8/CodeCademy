# Cleaning US Census Data

The Census Bureau collects census data and creates interesting visualizations and insights from it.

## Data:

It is in multiple CSV files. 

## Goals:

- combine all CSV files to one dataframe,
- convert data to right data types,
- separate some column values into few new columns that will make more sense,
- find and fill NaN values,
- check data for duplicates,
- make scatterplots and histograms to analyze data.
